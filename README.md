# The Sweet Dreams Library
The Sweet Dreams Library is a small web application created as a "pet project" to cover techniques taught in my first semester JavaScript course. No CSS frameworks were permitted, however, jQuery was allowed.

I've hosted it on my Codepen:

### The Idea
Some evenings, my daughter has difficulty choosing which books to read before bed. This application randomly outputs two books from her library. It uses jQuery, HTML and CSS.

### Functional Priorities
Proposed priorities for the MVP were:
- Random Output of 2 books from an array
- A photo of the book cover
- No repeat choices in sequential runs
- An "exciting reveal" or some kind of engaging animation (App meant for a toddler)

### Future Iterations
Future iterations could include:
- Books included via a database for scalability
- Additional filters, such as for authors or themes.
- A favourites option (recommend books more or less often)
